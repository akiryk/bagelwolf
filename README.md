# Bagelwolf

A static marketing site for a bagel bakery.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Astro](https://astro.build/) – static site generator
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – utility-first CSS framework

**Why this stack?** Goal is a fast, content-first marketing site with minimal JavaScript. Astro's static-first approach and Tailwind's utility classes provide a lean, performant foundation without the overhead of heavier frameworks like Next.js or full React SPAs.
