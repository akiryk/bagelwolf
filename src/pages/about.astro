        <p>
          BagelWolf is Adam Kiryk, a transplant from Brookline, Massachusetts who grew up on
          northeastern-style bagels. After a career in design and software development, Adam left
          to pursue his passion for baking sourdough breads.
        </p>
        <p>
          He's studied bread baking at the San Francisco Baking Institute, and he's staged at
          bakeries and bagel-making establishments in Boulder, Chicago, and Cambridge. Now he
          brings that experience to Durango, Colorado.

        The Process
      </h2>
      <div class="text-stone-600 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-6">
        <p>
          Every BagelWolf bagel starts with a homemade sourdough starter, fed daily with a blend
          of whole wheat and all-purpose flours. This living culture is the heart of what gives
          our bagels their distinctive flavor and character.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dough is hand-rolled using the traditional coil technique — a method that creates
          the perfect shape and texture that machine-made bagels simply can't replicate. After
          shaping, each bagel undergoes a 24-hour cold fermentation. This slow process develops
          complex flavors and creates the ideal crust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the bagels are boiled (the step most "bagels" skip) and then baked until
          golden. The result is a bagel with a satisfying chew, a slight tang from the sourdough,
          and a crust that has just the right amount of crackle.
