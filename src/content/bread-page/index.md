  All our breads are naturally leavened with the same sourdough starter we use
  for our bagels. Long, slow fermentation for maximum flavor and digestibility.

  Great bread takes time. Our loaves ferment slowly — often 24 hours or more —
  to develop complex flavors and a tender, digestible crumb.


  We shape each loaf by hand, score them with care, and bake them until the
  crust is deeply caramelized. The result is bread with character: crusty on the
  outside, soft and airy within.
