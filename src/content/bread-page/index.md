  I bake sourdough bread as well as bagels but I'm not yet baking in quantity to
  sell or distribute. Please reach our or check back!


  All my breads are naturally leavened with the same sourdough starter used with my bagels. 
items:
  - name: Country Sourdough

    description: Dense, seeded Danish rye bread — hearty and full of flavor.
infoTitle: Bread Philosophy
infoBody: >-
  Great bread takes time. My loaves ferment slowly — often 24 hours or more —
  and develop complex flavors and a tender, digestible crumb.


  I shape each loaf by hand, score them with care, and bake them until the crust is deeply caramelized. The result is bread with character: crusty on the outside, soft and airy within.


  Yum.

  What a great business model! Anyway, reach out to bagelwolfbakery@gmail.com. "
