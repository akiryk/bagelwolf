  All my breads are naturally leavened with the same sourdough starter used with
  my bagels. Long, slow fermentation for maximum flavor and digestibility. Yum. 


  Yum!

  Great bread takes time. My loaves ferment slowly — often 24 hours or more —
  and develop complex flavors and a tender, digestible crumb.


  I shape each loaf by hand, score them with care, and bake them until the crust is deeply caramelized. The result is bread with character: crusty on the outside, soft and airy within.


  Yum.
