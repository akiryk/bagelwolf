Bagelwolf is Adam Kiryk, a transplant from Brookline, Massachusettswho grew up on northeastern-style bagels. After a career in designand software development, Adam left to pursue his passion for baking.


Every bagel is made with a homemade sourdough starter, hand-rolledusing the traditional coil technique, and cold-fermented for 24hours to develop the perfect flavor and crust. The result? Chewy,flavorful bagels that taste like they should.
