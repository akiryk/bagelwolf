  Every bagel is made with sourdough starter, hand-rolled, and cold-fermented
  overnight to develop the perfect flavor and crust. My goal is chewy, flavorful
  bagels that taste like they should.

  A real bagel should have chew. It should have a slight tang from natural
  fermentation and a crust that crackles when you bite into it. It should be
  boiled before it's baked — that's what gives it that distinctive density and
  shine.


  Too many "bagels" today are just round bread. I'm here to make bagels the way they should be made: with time, care, and respect for the craft.
