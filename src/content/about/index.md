processBody: >-
  Every Bagelwolf bagel starts with a homemade sourdough starter, fed daily with
  a blend of whole-wheat and all-purpose flours. This living culture is at the
  heart of what gives our bagels their distinctive flavor and character.


  The dough is hand-rolled using a traditional technique—a method that produces an intentionally irregular (read: perfect) shape and texture that machine-made bagels simply can’t replicate. If you’re curious how the NYC pros do it, [here’s a great video](https://youtu.be/PXco1fwVPd0?si=hS9nM9PS1tLm24gG&t=427). And if you want to see how I do it, there’s a slightly less polished—but very real—[version here](https://www.instagram.com/p/DTtQi6SD_ob/).


  After shaping, the bagels undergo an overnight retard: a long, cold fermentation that develops deeper flavor and creates a crisp crust with fine micro-blistering.


  Finally, the bagels are boiled and baked. The result is a bagel with a satisfying chew, a subtle sourdough tang, and a crust with just the right amount of crackle.

    description: Every ingredient matters. I use high-quality flours and
      ingredients, and I sweat the details such as consistently microblistered
      crust.
  - title: Small Batch
    description: "I bake in small batches to ensure freshness and consistency in
      every bagel and loaf. Also because I can't really make more than a few
      dozen at a time even if I wanted to make more. "

    description: "Made right here in Durango, with care and attention that only a
      micro bakery can provide. "
  - title: Traditional Craft
    description: "My bagels are hand-rolled, boiled, and baked using time-honored
      techniques. Well, I'm using sourdough, which isn't exactly \"traditional\"
      — but it's fun, delicious, special, and gives it a little epes (which is
      Yiddish and means, you know, je ne sais quoi). "

**A work in progress**. I'm making bagels, but not yet ready to sell or distribute except to a small test audience. Please [reach out](mailto:bagelwolfbakery@gmail.com) if you're interested!

**Feedback**: If you've tried my bagels or bread, I'd love your feedback! Please provide it with [this form](https://forms.gle/CWTYSkKffswJyMFi6). Thank you.

**Bagelwolf** is Adam Kiryk, a transplant from Brookline, Massachusetts
who grew up on northeastern-style bagels. After a career in design
and software development in the Boston area, Adam left for Durango to pursue his love for the outdoors and his passion for baking sourdough breads.

Every bagel is made with sourdough starter, hand-rolled, and cold-fermented overnight to develop the perfect flavor and crust. My goal is chewy, flavorful bagels that taste like they should.

**What's with the name?** Who doesn't secretly want to wolf down a bagel? Who doesn't love wolves? Isn't the name *Wolf* kind of cool? Anyway, my conception of a bagel-wolf: a character who's cerebral and sophisticated — maybe a little bit fastidious and perfectionistic — but certainly friendly and accessible (or, at least as accessible as an erudite wolf can be). Also, the name "bagelwolf" wasn't already taken.
