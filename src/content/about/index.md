Bagelwolf is Adam Kiryk, a transplant from Brookline, Massachusetts
who grew up on northeastern-style bagels. After a career in design
and software development, Adam left to pursue his passion for baking sourdough breads.

Every bagel is made with a homemade sourdough starter, hand-rolled
using the traditional coil technique, and cold-fermented for 24
hours to develop the perfect flavor and crust. The result? Chewy,
flavorful bagels that taste like they should.
