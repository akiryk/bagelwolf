**A work in progress**. I'm making bagels, but not yet ready to sell or distribute except to a small test audience. Please [reach out](bagelwolfbakery@gmail.com) if you're interested!

**Feedback**: If you've tried my bagels or bread, I'd love your feedback! Please provide it with [this form](https://forms.gle/CWTYSkKffswJyMFi6). Thank you.

**Bagelwolf** is Adam Kiryk, a transplant from Brookline, Massachusetts
who grew up on northeastern-style bagels. After a career in design
and software development in the Boston area, Adam left for Durango to pursue his love for the outdoors and his passion for baking sourdough breads.

Every bagel is made with sourdough starter, hand-rolled, and cold-fermented overnight develop the perfect flavor and crust. My goal is chewy, flavorful bagels that taste like they should.

**What's with the name?**

Who doesn't secretly want to wolf down a bagel? Who doesn't love wolves? Isn't the name *Wolf* kind of cool? My conception of a bagel-wolf is: a character who's cerebral and sophisticated, maybe a little bit fastidious and perfectionistic, but certainly friendly and accessible (or, at least as accessible as a somewhat erudite wolf can be). Also, the name "bagelwolf" wasn't already taken.
