processBody: >-
  Every Bagelwolf bagel starts with a homemade sourdough starter, fed daily with
  a blend of whole wheat and all-purpose flours. This living culture is the
  heart of what gives our bagels their distinctive flavor and character.


  The dough is hand-rolled using the traditional technique, a method that creates an irregular (read: perfect) shape and texture that machine-made bagels simply can't replicate. If you want to see how the NYC pros do it, check out [this video on youtube](https://youtu.be/PXco1fwVPd0?si=hS9nM9PS1tLm24gG&t=427). If you want to see how I do it, well, here's a [somewhat less impressive video](https://www.instagram.com/p/DTtQi6SD_ob/) to check out. 


  After shaping, the bagels are treated to an overnight *retard* — a long, cold fermentation period that develops complex flavors and creates a crust characterized by crisp micro-blisters. 


  Finally, the bagels are boiled and then baked. The result is a bagel with a satisfying chew, a slight tang from the sourdough, and a crust that has just the right amount of crackle.

      ingredients, and I sweat the details such as consistently microblistered
      crust.
  - title: Small Batch
    description: "I bake in small batches to ensure freshness and consistency in
      every bagel and loaf. Also because I can't really make more than a few
      dozen at a time even if I wanted to make more. "

      micro bakery can provide. "
  - title: Traditional Craft
    description: "My bagels are hand-rolled, boiled, and baked using time-honored
      techniques. Well, I'm using sourdough, which isn't exactly \"traditional\"
      — but it's fun, delicious, special, and gives it a little epesdik (you
      know, je ne sais quoi). "

**A work in progress**. I'm making bagels, but not yet ready to sell or distribute except to a small test audience. Please [reach out](bagelwolfbakery@gmail.com) if you're interested!

**Feedback**: If you've tried my bagels or bread, I'd love your feedback! Please provide it with [this form](https://forms.gle/CWTYSkKffswJyMFi6). Thank you.

**Bagelwolf** is Adam Kiryk, a transplant from Brookline, Massachusetts
who grew up on northeastern-style bagels. After a career in design
and software development in the Boston area, Adam left for Durango to pursue his love for the outdoors and his passion for baking sourdough breads.

Every bagel is made with sourdough starter, hand-rolled, and cold-fermented overnight develop the perfect flavor and crust. My goal is chewy, flavorful bagels that taste like they should.

**What's with the name?**

Who doesn't secretly want to wolf down a bagel? Who doesn't love wolves? Isn't the name *Wolf* kind of cool? My conception of a bagel-wolf is: a character who's cerebral and sophisticated, maybe a little bit fastidious and perfectionistic, but certainly friendly and accessible (or, at least as accessible as a somewhat erudite wolf can be). Also, the name "bagelwolf" wasn't already taken.
