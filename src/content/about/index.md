processBody: |
  Every Bagelwolf bagel starts with a homemade sourdough starter, fed daily with a blend of whole wheat and all-purpose flours. This living culture is the heart of what gives our bagels their distinctive flavor and character.

  The dough is hand-rolled using the traditional coil technique — a method that creates the perfect shape and texture that machine-made bagels simply can't replicate. After shaping, each bagel undergoes a 24-hour cold fermentation. This slow process develops complex flavors and creates the ideal crust.

  Finally, the bagels are boiled (the step most "bagels" skip) and then baked until golden. The result is a bagel with a satisfying chew, a slight tang from the sourdough, and a crust that has just the right amount of crackle.

**A work in progress**. I'm making bagels, but not yet ready to sell or distribute except to a small test audience. Please [reach out](bagelwolfbakery@gmail.com) if you're interested!

**Feedback**: If you've tried my bagels or bread, I'd love your feedback! Please provide it with [this form](https://forms.gle/CWTYSkKffswJyMFi6). Thank you.

**Bagelwolf** is Adam Kiryk, a transplant from Brookline, Massachusetts
who grew up on northeastern-style bagels. After a career in design
and software development in the Boston area, Adam left for Durango to pursue his love for the outdoors and his passion for baking sourdough breads.

Every bagel is made with sourdough starter, hand-rolled, and cold-fermented overnight develop the perfect flavor and crust. My goal is chewy, flavorful bagels that taste like they should.

**What's with the name?**

Who doesn't secretly want to wolf down a bagel? Who doesn't love wolves? Isn't the name *Wolf* kind of cool? My conception of a bagel-wolf is: a character who's cerebral and sophisticated, maybe a little bit fastidious and perfectionistic, but certainly friendly and accessible (or, at least as accessible as a somewhat erudite wolf can be). Also, the name "bagelwolf" wasn't already taken.
